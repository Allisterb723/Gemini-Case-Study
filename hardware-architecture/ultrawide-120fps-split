**Author:** Allister Barnes
**Tools Used:** Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, Custom Resolution Utility (CRU), Windows 11
**Hardware:** Acer Ultrawide Monitor (Novatek Chipset), Active Signal Splitter

### The Challenge
I needed to route a specific **Ultrawide resolution** signal at a **high refresh rate (120Hz)** to a secondary monitor. Due to port constraints, this required an external splitter.

The introduction of the splitter caused a handshake failure. The system defaulted to a standard 16:9 aspect ratio at 60Hz, completely locking out the native Ultrawide resolution and the 120Hz capability.

### Phase 1: AI-Assisted Component Selection
Before troubleshooting, I utilized Gemini 1.5 Pro to architect the physical setup.
* **The Constraint:** Standard splitters often lack the bandwidth for Ultrawide resolutions at high refresh rates (pixel clock limitations).
* **The Solution:** I used the LLM to parse technical specifications of hardware candidates, filtering for an **active bi-directional splitter** with confirmed EDID passthrough and sufficient bandwidth to support the specific Ultrawide pixel count.

### Phase 2: The "Novatek" Logic Breakthrough
Once the verified splitter was installed, the correct resolution and refresh rate were still missing from Windows settings.

1.  **Analysis:** I provided the LLM with the diagnostic output from **CRU (Custom Resolution Utility)**.
2.  **The Finding:** Gemini identified a discrepancy: The OS was loading a generic "Acer" driver profile that was being filtered by the splitter. However, the raw hardware identifier revealed a **"Novatek"** controller chip capable of much tighter timing parameters.
3.  **The Fix:** We bypassed the standard driver logic. We manually configured a **Detailed Timing Block** in CRU, explicitly defining the **Ultrawide resolution** (e.g., 2560x1080 / 3440x1440) combined with the **120Hz vertical total**, using the specific "LCD standard" timings required by the Novatek chip.

### Outcome
By manually forcing the signal parameters to match the raw hardware capabilities—ignoring the software bottlenecks—we successfully restored the full **Ultrawide resolution at 120Hz**. This validated the hardware architecture and proved that the "incompatible" setup was actually a software configuration error solvable with AI reasoning.
